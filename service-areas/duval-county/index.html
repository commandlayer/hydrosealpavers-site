      <h2 class="section-title">Why Paver Sealing Matters in Duval County</h2>
      <p class="section-sub">
        Duval County pavers deal with real-world abuse: sun and UV, storm-season downpours, shaded growth, and lots of daily traffic.
        Sealing is about long-term protection — not a quick “shine job.”
      </p>

     <div class="hazard-split">
  <div class="card hazard-copy hazard-blue" style="padding:18px;">
    <h3 style="margin-top:0;">1) UV + Heat Fade Driveways and Front Walks</h3>
    <p>
      Full sun hits hard in Jacksonville and surrounding neighborhoods. Over time, pavers can lose depth, look patchy,
      and feel “chalky.” A quality sealer helps reduce UV impact and keeps the surface looking more even.
    </p>

    <h3>2) Shade + Organic Runoff = Dark Spots and Slick Growth</h3>
    <p>
      Duval has plenty of tree canopy and shaded areas that trap moisture. That’s where algae and mildew take hold,
      especially on patios, side yards, and north-facing sections. Proper cleaning + sealing helps reduce absorption
      and makes maintenance easier.
    </p>

    <h3>3) Heavy Rain Washes Out Joint Sand (That’s When Problems Start)</h3>
    <p>
      When joints wash out, weeds and ants move in, and pavers can start shifting or rocking. This is one of the most
      common “why does my driveway feel uneven?” causes. A correct process includes re-sanding and stabilization so joints stay tight.
    </p>

    <h3>4) Pool Decks + Travertine Need a Controlled System</h3>
    <p>
      Around pools, slippery surfaces and uneven application are the big risks. Travertine and natural stone also require
      the right product and technique. The goal is a clean, premium finish that stays functional — not tacky or overdone.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Paver Sealing FAQ — Jacksonville & Duval County</h2>
    <p class="section-sub">
      Straight answers to the most common paver sealing questions from homeowners in Jacksonville, FL and across Duval County.
    </p>

    <div class="stack" style="margin-top:16px;">

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary><strong>How often should pavers be sealed in Jacksonville, FL?</strong></summary>
        <div class="faq-body">
          <p class="muted">
            In Jacksonville and Duval County, most pavers should be resealed every <strong>2–3 years</strong>.
            Full sun exposure, heavy summer rain, and frequent washing can shorten that timeline.
            Driveways and pool decks in open, high-sun areas usually wear faster than shaded patios.
          </p>
          <p class="muted">
            Waiting until the sealer is completely gone often means heavier cleaning and more prep.
            Recoating <strong>before total wear-through</strong> keeps costs lower and results more consistent.
          </p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary><strong>Why do paver joints wash out so fast in Duval County?</strong></summary>
        <div class="faq-body">
          <p class="muted">
            Jacksonville gets intense rain events, irrigation overspray, and storm runoff.
            Over time, this washes joint sand out — especially on sloped driveways and near pool decks.
          </p>
          <p class="muted">
            Once joints open up, weeds, ants, and shifting pavers follow.
            That’s why proper <strong>joint re-sanding and stabilization</strong> is a critical part of professional paver sealing,
            not an optional add-on.
          </p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary><strong>Can pavers with algae, mildew, or dark staining still be sealed?</strong></summary>
        <div class="faq-body">
          <p class="muted">
            Yes — but only if the staining is treated correctly first.
            Sealing over algae, mildew, or organic staining will trap it and often make it darker or patchy.
          </p>
          <p class="muted">
            In humid Jacksonville conditions, proper chemistry, dwell time, and rinsing matter.
            <strong>Prep is the product</strong>. Clean first, seal second — never the other way around.
          </p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary><strong>Does paver sealing help with oil stains, rust, and fertilizer marks?</strong></summary>
        <div class="faq-body">
          <p class="muted">
            Sealing helps <strong>reduce absorption</strong> and makes cleanup much easier,
            especially for common Duval County issues like oil drips, rust from furniture,
            fertilizer overspray, and leaf tannins.
          </p>
          <p class="muted">
            No sealer makes pavers “stain-proof,” but a quality system buys you time
            and prevents stains from soaking in immediately.
            Fast cleanup still matters.
          </p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary><strong>Will sealing make my pool deck slippery in Jacksonville’s heat?</strong></summary>
        <div class="faq-body">
          <p class="muted">
            It can if the wrong finish is used or the sealer is over-applied.
            Slippery pool decks are almost always caused by puddling or a heavy “wet look” buildup.
          </p>
          <p class="muted">
            Pool decks in Jacksonville require a <strong>controlled application</strong>
            and, when appropriate, traction-friendly options.
            The goal is a clean, premium finish that stays comfortable and walkable — even when wet.
          </p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary><strong>What’s the biggest paver sealing mistake homeowners make in Duval County?</strong></summary>
        <div class="faq-body">
          <p class="muted">
            Waiting too long.
            Once joints are washed out and pavers start shifting, sealing alone won’t fix the problem.
            Structural or drainage issues need to be addressed first.
          </p>
          <p class="muted">
            Sealing is surface protection — not a structural repair.
            If we see sinking, rocking, or drainage problems, we’ll explain the right fix
            before any sealer is applied.
